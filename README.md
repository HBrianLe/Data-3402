Within this repository, we have 3 subjected folders.
<ul>
<li>Project One</li>

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Midterm </li>
<ul>
<li>Working with various bash line commands to work with given data. This mostly contains problems with their respective line of code.</li>

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Project Two </li>
<ul>
<li>This is a Database and SQL project. Using the first project, we extracted data from one of the folders that we had downloaded. We then used SQL to load the data into SQL databases. </li>
<li>We had used bash line commands to load SQL data into a database file. This file contains separate keys and excel files to connect the entire database together. </li>
<ul>
<li>Two Files that will be contained </li>

<ul>
<li> baseball.sql - This is a file that allows the database to read in the data that we will be using for ths project. Built using sql language, use 
               sqlite3 in the linux terminal to do .read on these files to build the baseball.db file</li>
<li> Project.ipnb - This file is the project file that includes part one and two of the project. This contains project instructions and sql queries that are asked in this project</li>

<li> DataBase: The file is too big to be downloaded here. We will use Google Drive Download instead.
