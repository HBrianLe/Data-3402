# Data 3402: Project 1: Downloads and Directories 

For this project, we download files from various Baseball data websites including:


<li>Lahmanâ€™s Baseball Database </li>
<li>Retosheets </li>
<li>gd2.mlb.com (This site is now down and broken) </li>

Files here are meant to be made in a Python file and the same in Jupyter Notebook files. Both are for bash commands.
